# SE-Assignment-4
Assignment: GitHub and Visual Studio
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of GitHub and Visual Studio. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Introduction to GitHub:

What is GitHub, and what are its primary functions and features? Explain how it supports collaborative software development
 Repositories on GitHub:

GitHub allows you to create, store, change, merge, and collaborate on files or code.The primary functions of github is hosts Git repositories and provides developers with tools to ship better code through command line features, issues (threaded discussions), pull requests, code review, or the use of a collection of free and for-purchase apps in the GitHub Marketplace. Supportive collaboration of GitHub in software development is that GitHub is a web platform that provides a centralized location for hosting Git repositories. It adds a user-friendly interface, issue tracking, pull request management, and more, making collaborative development efficient and intuitive.

What is a GitHub repository? Describe how to create a new repository and the essential elements that should be included in it.
Version Control with Git:

GitHub repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It's a place where you can store your code, your files, and each file's revision history repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

* How to create new repository and its essential elements that should be included in it are *
1. After you create an account on GitHub, you’ll be taken to your new GitHub dashboard. You should see a green button that says, “Create repository.”

2. When you click on this green button, it will take you to the “New repository page” which allows you to enter a repository name, select an owner of that repository (you, in this case), add a description for your repository on what your project is about, and choose whether to make the project public or private.

3. From here, you can initialize your project with a README. A README file in a GitHub repository provides essential information about the project, including its purpose, usage instructions, how to get started, where to find help, and details on contributors.

Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers?
Branching and Merging in GitHub:
Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. Example of version control system is Git which was developed in 2005.

As Version control for developers github does the following,
1. Code Hosting: GitHub provides a centralized platform for hosting Git repositories. Developers can create public or private repositories to store their code and collaborate with others.
2. Collaboration Tools: GitHub offers a range of collaboration tools, including pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking. These tools facilitate communication and coordination among team members, ensuring a smooth development process.

What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Pull Requests and Code Reviews:Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.


1. GitHub branches is a new/separate version of the main repository that allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.
2. The process of creating a branch, make changes and merging it into the main branch involves the following
**_CREATING A BRANCH_**
a. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
b. From the file tree view on the left, select the  branch dropdown menu, then click View all branches. You can also find the branch dropdown menu at the top of the integrated file editor.
c. Click New branch.
d. Under "Branch name", type a name for the branch.
e. Under "Branch source", choose a source for your branch.
f. If your repository is a fork, select the repository dropdown menu and click your fork or the upstream repository.
g. Select the branch dropdown menu and click a branch.
h. Click Create branch.

**_MAKING CHANGES AND MERGING IT INTO MAIN BRANCH_**
a. In GitHub Desktop, click  Current Branch.
b. Click Choose a branch to merge into BRANCH.
c. Click the branch you want to merge into the current branch, then click Merge BRANCH into BRANCH.

**Note**: If there are merge conflicts, GitHub Desktop will warn you above the Merge BRANCH into BRANCH button. You will not be able to merge the branches until you have resolved all conflicts.
e. To push your local changes to the remote repository, in the repository bar, click Push origin.

What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.
GitHub Actions:

Pull request in GitHub is a Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

**STEPS ON CREATING AND REVIEWING OF PULL REQUEST ARE**
1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. In the "Branch" menu, choose the branch that contains your commits.
3. Above the list of files, in the yellow banner, click Compare & pull request to create a pull request for the associated branch.
4. Use the base branch dropdown menu to select the branch you'd like to merge your changes into, then use the compare branch drop-down menu to choose the topic branch you made your changes in.
5. Type a title and description for your pull request.

**REVIEWING PULL REQUEST**
1. Under your repository name, click  Pull requests.
2. In the list of pull requests, click the pull request that you'd like to ask a specific person or a team to review.
3. To request a review from a suggested person under Reviewers, next to their username, click Request.
4. Optionally, to request a review from someone other than a suggested person, click Reviewers.
5. After your pull request is reviewed and you've made the necessary changes, you can ask a reviewer to re-review your pull request

Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
Introduction to Visual Studio:

 GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. GitHub Actions goes beyond just DevOps and lets you run workflows when other events happen in your repository. For example, you can run a workflow to automatically add the appropriate labels whenever someone creates a new issue in your repository.

You can configure a GitHub Actions workflow to be triggered when an event occurs in your repository, such as a pull request being opened or an issue being created. Your workflow contains one or more jobs which can run in sequential order or in parallel. Each job will run inside its own virtual machine runner, or inside a container, and has one or more steps that either run a script that you define or run an action, which is a reusable extension that can simplify your workflow.

What is Visual Studio, and what are its key features? How does it differ from Visual Studio Code?
Integrating GitHub with Visual Studio:

Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment(IDE) developed by Microsoft to develop Desktop applications, GUI(Graphical User Interface), console, web applications, mobile applications, cloud, and web services, etc. Key features of  are 
1. Develop
2. Debug
3. Test
4. Collaborate
5. Design

The difference between visual studio and visual studio code is that Visual Studio” serves as a unified development environment (IDE), while “Visual Studio Code” is a sophisticated text editor akin to Sublime Text or Atom. Visual studio run on Mac and windows while Visual studio code runs on Mac, Windows and linux. However Visual studio does not support customization while visual studio code supports customization. 

Describe the steps to integrate a GitHub repository with Visual Studio. How does this integration enhance the development workflow?
Debugging in Visual Studio:
**HOW TO CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY WITH VISUAL STUDIO**
1. Open Visual Studio, and then select Create a new project.
2. From the Git menu, select Create Git Repository.
3. In the Create a Git repository dialog, under the Push to a new remote section, choose GitHub.
4. In the Create a new GitHub repository section of the Create a Git repository dialog, enter the name of the repo you want to create. (If you haven't yet signed in to your GitHub account, you can do so from this screen, too.)
5. After you sign in and enter your repo info, select the Create and Push button to create your repo and add your app.

Linking GitHub with Visual Studio allows you to manage your code repositories, collaborate with others, and streamline your development workflow directly from your IDE. Visual Studio provides integrated tools for cloning, creating, and managing GitHub repositories.

Explain the debugging tools available in Visual Studio. How can developers use these tools to identify and fix issues in their code?
Collaborative Development using GitHub and Visual Studio:

Debugging can mean a lot of different things, but most literally, it means removing bugs from your code.
A debugger is a very specialized developer tool that attaches to your running app and allows you to inspect your code. In the debugging documentation for Visual Studio, this is typically what we mean when we say "debugging".
Integration Features
**Version Control**: Visual Studio integrates with GitHub, allowing developers to commit, pull, and push changes directly from the IDE.
**Code Review**: GitHub's pull request feature enables team members to review and discuss code changes, which can be seamlessly integrated with Visual Studio.
**Issue Tracking**: GitHub's issue tracking system can be accessed and managed within Visual Studio, allowing developers to stay organized and address project tasks efficiently.
**Continuous Integration**: Visual Studio can be configured to trigger automated builds and tests using GitHub Actions, ensuring code quality and reliability.

**_Real-World Example_**
One real-world example of a project benefiting from this integration is a web application development project. Let's consider a team building an e-commerce platform using ASP.NET Core in Visual Studio and hosting the code on GitHub.

**Version Control****: Developers can work on different features or bug fixes in Visual Studio and seamlessly commit their changes to GitHub, allowing for easy collaboration and tracking of code modifications.

**Code Review**: When a developer completes a feature, they can create a pull request on GitHub. Other team members can review the code changes, provide feedback, and suggest improvements, all within the GitHub interface.

**Issue Tracking**: The team can use GitHub's issue tracking system to manage tasks and bugs. These issues can be linked to the code in Visual Studio, providing a seamless workflow for issue resolution.

**Continuous Integration**: Visual Studio can be configured to trigger GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment, ensuring that new code changes are thoroughly tested before being merged into the main branch.
